# Improving physics-informed neural networks with an adaptive Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) loss weighting algorithm
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a relatively new type of neural network that offers a promising solution to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially those that are too complex for traditional numerical approaches. They accomplish this by embedding the governing PDE into the neural network’s loss function. However, applying PINNs to complex problems remains challenging. The training process tends to overlook sharp gradients or singular behavior like those present in many open problems such as the Navier-Stokes existence/smoothness. Furthermore, traditional PINNs require extremely high precision and therefore a large amount of compute to predict these outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a PINN that applies an adaptive loss weighting algorithm inspired by Fourier analysis. Our algorithm randomly samples line segments from the domain and computes the proportion of error attributed to high frequency oscillations. PINNs struggle with high frequency information so this is a way to compensate. Numerical experiments show the adaptive loss weighting algorithm increases areas of the domain with the highest precision, potentially offering a more efficient approach for solving PDEs.
